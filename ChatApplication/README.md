# Command Line Chat Application

## Project Description
This project is a basic command-line chat application developed using Python.
It follows a client-server architecture where multiple users can communicate
with each other in real time through a central server.

## Features
- Real-time text-based messaging
- Client-server communication using sockets
- Supports multiple clients
- Simple and lightweight command-line interface

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Socket Programming
- Multithreading

## How to Run
1. Open a terminal and start the server:
   python server.py

2. Open another terminal and start a client:
   python client.py

3. Run multiple clients to test real-time chat.

## Usage
- Type messages and press Enter to send
- Type 'exit' to disconnect from the chat

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates basic networking concepts,
socket communication, and multithreading in Python.
